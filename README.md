# eCommerce

Demoshop is an eCommerce web application built with React on the frontend and Django for the backend. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for users to enjoy shopping online. It purposely does not include every conceivable feature of an e-commerce website; instead, Demoshop aims to provide core features that most e-commerce websites have. The website is hosted on Heroku and has AWS RDS&S3 to hold the database/files.
